00:00:00,330  -->  00:00:05,460
Welcome back to the advanced course on Tablo and the previous tutorial we created these a beautiful

2

00:00:05,460  -->  00:00:06,930
four box plots.

3

00:00:06,930  -->  00:00:10,470
And today we're going to learn how to analyze them.

4

00:00:10,470  -->  00:00:14,360
We've got quite a lot of ground to cover so let's jump straight into it.

5

00:00:14,370  -->  00:00:21,780
First off I'd like to make sure that everybody is on the same page and therefore let's look at how exactly

6

00:00:21,840  -->  00:00:23,780
box plots work.

7

00:00:23,820  -->  00:00:28,290
So I'm going to bring up a slide that I've prepared very excited about this.

8

00:00:28,290  -->  00:00:28,680
All right.

9

00:00:28,680  -->  00:00:33,960
So let's say you have an access as it can be vertical horizontal in all cases vertical so let's stick

10

00:00:33,960  -->  00:00:39,540
with that and you have a certain number of observations that you can plot on this axis.

11

00:00:39,570  -->  00:00:41,630
So there are 10 observations.

12

00:00:41,820  -->  00:00:46,470
Now in order to create an a box plot which you have to do is you have to physically count the number

13

00:00:46,470  -->  00:00:51,970
of observations of one two three up to 10 and then take the middle between them.

14

00:00:52,020  -->  00:00:58,030
So in our case there's an even number of observations so there is no one middle observation.

15

00:00:58,080  -->  00:00:59,630
The middle ones are 5 and six.

16

00:00:59,670  -->  00:01:05,810
So we are going to put a line exactly between Fifth the fifth and the sixth observation.

17

00:01:05,820  -->  00:01:11,900
Now what are we going to do is we're going to do the same thing for the top five here.

18

00:01:11,910  -->  00:01:12,720
We've counted.

19

00:01:12,780  -->  00:01:14,040
We have five observations.

20

00:01:14,040  -->  00:01:15,870
The middle one is number three.

21

00:01:15,900  -->  00:01:17,770
We put a line through that one.

22

00:01:17,770  -->  00:01:20,360
Now those are the exact same thing for the bottom half.

23

00:01:20,360  -->  00:01:21,540
One two three for five.

24

00:01:21,540  -->  00:01:23,480
This is the middle one over here.

25

00:01:23,520  -->  00:01:24,790
So we put a line through it.

26

00:01:24,810  -->  00:01:31,310
Now if we replace these lines with a box we are slowly starting to create a box plot.

27

00:01:31,320  -->  00:01:37,350
Now all we have to do is plot the whiskers so the whisker goes all the way up to the top one over here

28

00:01:37,410  -->  00:01:43,200
and the other whisker goes all the way up to the bottom one here and elements of the book's plot have

29

00:01:43,290  -->  00:01:44,250
their own names.

30

00:01:44,250  -->  00:01:45,360
This is the minimum.

31

00:01:45,450  -->  00:01:48,710
This is the first quartile or the lower quartile.

32

00:01:48,720  -->  00:01:50,120
This is the median.

33

00:01:50,160  -->  00:01:52,950
This is the upper quartile of the third quarter.

34

00:01:52,980  -->  00:01:54,680
And this is the maximum.

35

00:01:54,960  -->  00:01:56,910
And just make sure you don't get confused here.

36

00:01:56,910  -->  00:02:01,960
This is not the mean this is the median and that's because of the way we've constructed it.

37

00:02:02,100  -->  00:02:05,820
So that is how a box plot gets built.

38

00:02:05,820  -->  00:02:12,540
So basically it's about counting the number of records and breaking it up into four Court-House So every

39

00:02:12,540  -->  00:02:16,830
single Courtown has an equal number of records in it.

40

00:02:16,830  -->  00:02:20,260
Now let's look at another example here again another axis.

41

00:02:20,310  -->  00:02:24,090
We've got our observations and let's do the same thing.

42

00:02:24,090  -->  00:02:28,170
So that's our median that is going to be our first quartile.

43

00:02:28,260  -->  00:02:30,620
That is our third quartile.

44

00:02:30,630  -->  00:02:32,640
Now if we connect them that's our box.

45

00:02:32,930  -->  00:02:38,730
And now what we can do here is if we measure the distance between the third quarter and the first quarter

46

00:02:38,740  -->  00:02:40,930
it is called the entire quartal range.

47

00:02:41,070  -->  00:02:47,040
Well the way we can sort box plots is we want to make sure that our analysis is not affected by outliers

48

00:02:47,060  -->  00:02:47,100
.

49

00:02:47,130  -->  00:02:53,290
So if any observation falls too far away then we want to exclude it from the construction of boxwood

50

00:02:53,360  -->  00:02:53,640
.

51

00:02:53,730  -->  00:02:56,330
And how do we determine if an observation is too far away.

52

00:02:56,370  -->  00:03:01,190
Well you need to take one and a half times the entire quarter mile range.

53

00:03:01,410  -->  00:03:03,300
And that is going to be a cutoff point.

54

00:03:03,300  -->  00:03:08,350
So if an observation falls further than that then you shouldn't include it in the box.

55

00:03:08,400  -->  00:03:10,400
And it's considered an outlier.

56

00:03:10,560  -->  00:03:16,270
So in this case our box flight is going to look like this and that Separ or out there is considered

57

00:03:16,270  -->  00:03:17,580
to be an outlier.

58

00:03:17,590  -->  00:03:20,040
All right so that's how books plus are constructed.

59

00:03:20,050  -->  00:03:24,550
Now let's have a look at a few sample use cases of box plots.

60

00:03:24,580  -->  00:03:29,440
So here I've got a horizontal axis and for a change we're going to be looking at horizontal box plots

61

00:03:29,830  -->  00:03:36,430
and to make things interesting let's say we're analyzing sales representatives and their daily sales

62

00:03:36,430  -->  00:03:36,640
.

63

00:03:36,640  -->  00:03:42,280
So what would you rather would you rather have your observations plotted like this or would you rather

64

00:03:42,280  -->  00:03:44,200
have your observations planned like this.

65

00:03:44,350  -->  00:03:46,660
In both cases the median is the same.

66

00:03:46,660  -->  00:03:48,700
It is a thousand dollars.

67

00:03:48,700  -->  00:03:55,420
Now this is where we can look at the book's plot and if we create the box put for the first example

68

00:03:55,450  -->  00:03:57,920
you will see that it is quite compact like that.

69

00:03:57,940  -->  00:04:02,570
The second box plot is much more wider.

70

00:04:02,590  -->  00:04:10,150
So what does that tell us that tells us that the variance in the first box plot is lower so you have

71

00:04:10,330  -->  00:04:13,050
more chances of being closer to the median.

72

00:04:13,060  -->  00:04:18,340
You can only from the observation that we have you are only going to be somewhere between these two

73

00:04:18,340  -->  00:04:24,970
whiskers and more likely you're actually going to be inside the second and third quarter owls groups

74

00:04:25,870  -->  00:04:28,940
and therefore you're more likely to be next to the median here.

75

00:04:29,050  -->  00:04:35,650
You have more room to go up what you have more room to go down so that basically means that the risk

76

00:04:35,650  -->  00:04:41,370
is higher or the volatility is higher and your sales reps can bring.

77

00:04:41,380  -->  00:04:48,700
They do bring a median back over a thousand dollars per day but at the same time it can it can really

78

00:04:48,700  -->  00:04:55,330
vary it can be anywhere on the right and you're on the left so you have more certainty from more compact

79

00:04:55,330  -->  00:04:59,770
box what you have less certainty with a wider box.

80

00:04:59,980  -->  00:05:06,940
Even given the same media and the way to think about it or another way to think about it is in terms

81

00:05:06,940  -->  00:05:13,330
of distribution so this distribution is narrower this distribution is wider so if we talk in terms of

82

00:05:13,330  -->  00:05:18,450
standard deviations instantiation is here is which is also a measure of variance.

83

00:05:18,460  -->  00:05:18,820
Right.

84

00:05:18,850  -->  00:05:25,930
So here the standard deviation is higher or larger here it's smaller so you have a more narrow distribution

85

00:05:25,930  -->  00:05:29,280
and you're more likely to actually hit the nail on the head here.

86

00:05:29,770  -->  00:05:33,340
Whereas here you can either go left or right which is more uncertain.

87

00:05:33,650  -->  00:05:35,790
OK let's have a look at another example.

88

00:05:36,370  -->  00:05:38,410
Can you tell me right away what do you think.

89

00:05:38,410  -->  00:05:41,220
Is this a good box or a bad box point.

90

00:05:41,470  -->  00:05:47,380
Let's say we're also measuring sales and now it's a vertical axis and of course would be better if it

91

00:05:47,380  -->  00:05:52,400
were compacter like this but is this a good box or a bad spot.

92

00:05:52,420  -->  00:06:00,190
And given that the minimum or the maximum are fixed and in essence the question we're asking is is this

93

00:06:00,190  -->  00:06:02,420
box a lot better than this box plot.

94

00:06:02,710  -->  00:06:08,080
And if you think of it in terms of median the median here is higher than the median here and it makes

95

00:06:08,080  -->  00:06:09,190
the answer obvious of course.

96

00:06:09,190  -->  00:06:12,160
This box Plaut is preferrable to this box.

97

00:06:12,160  -->  00:06:18,030
So basically if if your media minimum and maximum fixed you want your box the pot or the box part of

98

00:06:18,030  -->  00:06:28,020
the box what you want it to be as a higher or as closer as more closer to your desired result as possible

99

00:06:28,030  -->  00:06:32,560
so here we're talking about sales so the larger sales or higher sales are better.

100

00:06:32,560  -->  00:06:35,340
So we want the box to be higher not lower.

101

00:06:35,530  -->  00:06:37,720
But that is the obvious answer.

102

00:06:37,720  -->  00:06:44,500
How do how do we think of it in terms of distributions and how do we think of it exactly why this is

103

00:06:44,500  -->  00:06:48,300
the case so if we plot them now sideways so this is the good box plot.

104

00:06:48,310  -->  00:06:55,870
This is the bad box blood let's plot the observations that make these booklets happen.

105

00:06:55,860  -->  00:07:00,420
So these are 10 observations in this case and these are 10 observations in this case.

106

00:07:00,600  -->  00:07:03,670
How do we see them in terms of distributions.

107

00:07:03,780  -->  00:07:07,410
And for me personally this is the part that drives this point home.

108

00:07:07,410  -->  00:07:08,900
This is what makes things click.

109

00:07:08,910  -->  00:07:17,820
So I'm going to put distributions here and this here you can see that this is a Arite skewed distribution

110

00:07:17,840  -->  00:07:17,870
.

111

00:07:17,880  -->  00:07:23,460
And by the way right skewed is because the tails on the right not we don't look at the hump.

112

00:07:23,460  -->  00:07:30,730
We look at the tail where the tail is and that is how we define whether it's a right skewed or electrocuted

113

00:07:30,900  -->  00:07:31,070
.

114

00:07:31,140  -->  00:07:38,910
So this is a rice distribution and if you think of it in this sense what it's telling us is that if

115

00:07:38,910  -->  00:07:41,550
you throw a random observation.

116

00:07:41,550  -->  00:07:48,630
Another one observation onto this chart then it is more likely to end up in this area in this more dense

117

00:07:48,630  -->  00:07:54,240
area than it is on in this tale part right because that's how distributions work.

118

00:07:54,240  -->  00:07:59,810
There are more observations here so you've got your mean median mode in this part of the chart.

119

00:07:59,850  -->  00:08:03,240
And this part of the chart so you throw a Aranda bearable here.

120

00:08:03,270  -->  00:08:12,030
It is more likely to end up here and here and on this other side if you throw a random variable into

121

00:08:12,030  -->  00:08:18,750
this environment into this example then what will happen is it will more likely end up on the right

122

00:08:18,750  -->  00:08:19,210
side.

123

00:08:19,210  -->  00:08:24,560
So this is a left skewed distribution that tells on the left but most of the observations are concentrated

124

00:08:24,570  -->  00:08:29,150
over here so if you throw another round variable it will most likely end up here.

125

00:08:29,370  -->  00:08:37,050
And which is good for us because the sales are higher so that is how I personally think of books plus

126

00:08:37,060  -->  00:08:44,970
sometimes because you know we like distribution's we're used to them and they've got a lot of mathematics

127

00:08:44,970  -->  00:08:46,220
behind them.

128

00:08:46,230  -->  00:08:47,940
They got sand and things like that.

129

00:08:47,950  -->  00:08:52,160
Bookstores are also also great but they're simpler things I think.

130

00:08:52,170  -->  00:08:57,480
And when you think of them in terms of distributions it makes a lot of sense that why a box plot which

131

00:08:57,480  -->  00:09:00,760
is which looks like this is worse.

132

00:09:00,780  -->  00:09:04,490
If you want to be on the right of access then a box plot that looks like that.

133

00:09:04,780  -->  00:09:05,060
OK.

134

00:09:05,070  -->  00:09:08,030
So that is how box plots work.

135

00:09:08,070  -->  00:09:13,670
Let's not jump back into Tablo and see what analysis we can derive from them there.

136

00:09:13,680  -->  00:09:14,920
All right so there is our chart.

137

00:09:14,940  -->  00:09:16,700
What can we see from this chart.

138

00:09:16,710  -->  00:09:19,490
Knowing that everything we know now.

139

00:09:19,590  -->  00:09:21,990
Well right away we can see outliers here and here.

140

00:09:21,990  -->  00:09:27,510
So what this means is that in these three states in New South Wales Queensland and Victoria there are

141

00:09:27,510  -->  00:09:33,660
companies that are underperforming in terms of the overall performance in that specific state.

142

00:09:33,840  -->  00:09:36,670
Then in Queensland they are companies that are over performing.

143

00:09:36,810  -->  00:09:42,480
Also if you put your mouse over the box plus you will get some information which directly relates to

144

00:09:42,510  -->  00:09:45,350
the five points we discussed about box pots.

145

00:09:45,360  -->  00:09:50,920
So the minimum the lower cost tell the medium the upper quartile and the maximum.

146

00:09:51,180  -->  00:09:57,720
And if you use this information you can compare the box plots among each other and for instance we can

147

00:09:57,720  -->  00:10:01,230
say that this box plot has the highest median which is 8 percent.

148

00:10:01,230  -->  00:10:08,180
This one is also 8 percent but you can visually see that it's lower than this box part comes in a third

149

00:10:08,220  -->  00:10:13,680
so the state has the third median which is 6 percent and this one has a 4 percent.

150

00:10:13,950  -->  00:10:21,390
And finally let's talk about the variance and the sizes of the box plus you can see that this box plot

151

00:10:21,390  -->  00:10:26,640
here and this box plot here they are pretty big compared to these two box plots.

152

00:10:26,640  -->  00:10:33,090
And that means that the variance here is much greater so there is less certainty that the like a random

153

00:10:33,090  -->  00:10:39,500
company thrown into this one of these states will be performing at the median net profit margin.

154

00:10:39,570  -->  00:10:44,880
And bear in mind when we say random company we're not taking into account all the amazing things about

155

00:10:44,910  -->  00:10:50,760
our specific company we're not taking into account the product differentiation that we can offer the

156

00:10:50,760  -->  00:10:55,920
amazing customer service that we deliver and all those great things we were just saying if we throw

157

00:10:55,920  -->  00:11:04,180
in a random company that performs comparable to the companies in that specific state and you know it's

158

00:11:04,180  -->  00:11:09,190
work it's performing about a somewhere on average Wi-Fi on a certain level variance.

159

00:11:09,190  -->  00:11:10,780
Where will it end up.

160

00:11:10,780  -->  00:11:18,970
So it is likely to end up in this box but because the box is so big there is more uncertainty as to

161

00:11:19,180  -->  00:11:21,960
where it will be performing in this specific state.

162

00:11:21,960  -->  00:11:28,020
So basically we're kind of assessing the business environment in each of these states in Western Australia

163

00:11:28,030  -->  00:11:33,340
once again there is more uncertainty where your company will end up in terms of net profit margin because

164

00:11:33,340  -->  00:11:36,520
the bookstore is quite large here the box plus are smaller.

165

00:11:36,670  -->  00:11:42,130
And as you remember what we just discussed which one is better let's say here would you rather have

166

00:11:42,130  -->  00:11:47,170
this box here or would you have it up at the top you would rather have it up at the top because higher

167

00:11:47,170  -->  00:11:54,070
profit net profit margin is better for us so this is not the best set up in this specific said could

168

00:11:54,070  -->  00:11:58,210
have been better if this box had had been higher at the top would have been better.

169

00:11:58,240  -->  00:12:03,460
On the other hand in Victoria you can see that the box part of the box part is at the top meaning that

170

00:12:03,460  -->  00:12:07,720
the set up in this business environment is actually pretty good.

171

00:12:07,720  -->  00:12:12,880
You can see that the box part is quite compact meaning that there is less uncertainty in terms of where

172

00:12:13,180  -->  00:12:16,340
a random company would end up in terms of net profit margin.

173

00:12:16,510  -->  00:12:22,720
And also you can see that the median of course the median is higher than these two other states but

174

00:12:22,720  -->  00:12:28,950
also you can see that the box part of the box part is closer to where we want to be to the top.

175

00:12:29,050  -->  00:12:34,710
And as we discussed that's a good thing as better than if this box part was lower.

176

00:12:34,720  -->  00:12:38,830
So there we go that's how you analyze box plots and what can we conclude from here.

177

00:12:38,830  -->  00:12:45,180
Well we can say that out of these three states you know since we already are working in or the businesses

178

00:12:45,180  -->  00:12:51,430
operating in yourself wells out of these three states it's obvious that this state of Victoria is the

179

00:12:51,430  -->  00:12:57,400
better one in terms of expansion in terms of a business environment and this analysis has been performed

180

00:12:57,910  -->  00:13:00,710
based on competitor research.

181

00:13:00,700  -->  00:13:02,950
Now that's not the end of our challenge.

182

00:13:02,950  -->  00:13:07,960
We of course have to analyze the economies of these states.

183

00:13:07,960  -->  00:13:12,610
We have to analyze how the industries are performing and how the populations are growing things like

184

00:13:12,610  -->  00:13:12,730
that.

185

00:13:12,730  -->  00:13:14,650
So we will definitely get to that.

186

00:13:14,650  -->  00:13:20,110
This was like the very first stage and what we want to do now is when to use the rest of our analysis

187

00:13:20,110  -->  00:13:26,170
and hopefully back this finding that the business environment seems to be best for this specific industry

188

00:13:26,170  -->  00:13:28,220
at this specific time in Victoria.

189

00:13:28,480  -->  00:13:30,440
And I look for the next Tauriel.

190

00:13:30,460  -->  00:13:32,160
Until then happy on lising
